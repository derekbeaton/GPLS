abstract = "1. Methods used for the study of species-environment relationships can be grouped into: (i) simple indirect and direct gradient analysis and multivariate direct gradient analysis (e.g. canonical correspondence analysis), all of which search for non-symmetric patterns between environmental data sets and species data sets; and (ii) analysis of juxtaposed tables, canonical correlation analysis, and intertable ordination, which examine species-environment relationships by considering each data set equally. Different analytical techniques are appropriate for fulfilling different objectives, 2. We propose a method, co-inertia analysis, that can synthesize various approaches encountered in the ecological literature. Co-inertia analysis is based on the mathematically coherent Euclidean model and can be universally reproduced (i.e. independently of software) because of its numerical stability. The method performs simultaneous analysis of two tables. The optimizing criterion in co-inertia analysis is that the resulting sample scores (environmental scores and faunistic scores) are the most covariant. Such analysis is particularly suitable for the simultaneous detection of faunistic and environmental features in studies of ecosystem structure. 3. The method was demonstrated using faunistic and environmental data from Friday (Freshwater Biology 18, 87-104, 1987). In this example, non-symmetric analyses is inappropriate because of the large number of variables (species and environmental variables) compared with the small number of samples. 4. Co-inertia analysis is an extension of the analysis of cross tables previously attempted by others. It serves as a general method to relate any kinds of data set, using any kinds of standard analysis (e.g. principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, multiple correspondence analysis) or between-class and within-class analyses."

abstract = "In many fields (e.g., ecology, psychometrics, social science, and marketing), researchers are faced with the challenge of summarizing the information contained in large data sets. In this context, multivariate analysis provides efficient tools for identifying the relationships between variables and the similarities between statistical units/individuals. Due to the natural boundaries between disciplines or schools of thought, several multivariate methods have been invented and reinvented by different groups in different countries for different purposes. This situation has resulted in a variety of apparently different methods that actually lead to the same equations for analysing the same data. For instance, Greenacre (1984, Section 1.3) detailed the history of correspondence analysis (CA) and showed how this method has been rediscovered several times in biometrics, psychometrics, and linguistics. This process can be explained by the diversity of viewpoints adopted by researchers to describe a method (e.g., geometrical versus numerical or individual centred versus variable centred). Several authors have tried to provide a unifying mathematical framework to summarize the different properties of a given method, and thus to identify analogies between existing methods. The duality diagram theory was first presented in Cazes (1970) and popularized by Cailliez and Pagès (1976) in a French book entitled Introduction à l’Analyse des Données. Several French authors adopted this theory, but I believe that it remains poorly known by statisticians outside France. Daniel Chessel, my PhD advisor, used the duality diagram as a formal way to develop new multivariate methods in ecology (e.g., Dolédec and Chessel, 1994; Dolédec et al., 1996). He implemented this framework in the ADE-4 software (Thioulouse et al., 1997) and several years later in the R package ade4 (Chessel et al., 2004; Dray and Dufour, 2007; Dray et al., 2007). Hence, similarly to Obelix (Goscinny and Uderzo, 1989), I fell into the magical duality diagram when I was a little boy, and I have used it as a central framework in my further works."

abstract = "The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a generalization of the eigen-decomposition which can be used to analyze rectangular matrices (the eigen-decomposition is defined only for squared matrices). By analogy with the eigen-decomposition, which decomposes a matrix into two simple matrices, the main idea of the SVD is to decompose a rectangular matrix into three simple matrices:Two orthogonal matrices and one diagonal matrix.Because it gives a least square estimate of a given matrix by a lower rank matrix of same dimensions, the SVD is equivalent to principal component analysis (PCA) and metric multidimensional
scaling (MDS) and is therefore an essential tool for multivariate analysis. The generalized SVD(GSVD) decomposes a rectangular matrix and takes into account constraints imposed on the rows and the columns of the matrix. The GSVD gives a weighted generalized least square estimate of a given matrix by a lower rank matrix and therefore, with an adequate choice of the constraints, the GSVD implements all linear multivariate techniques (e.g.,canonical correlation, linear discriminant analysis, correspondence analysis,PLS-regression)."

	abstract = {The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is currently the strongest and most highly replicated genetic factor for risk and age of onset of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Using phylogenetic analysis, we have identified a polymorphic poly-T variant, rs10524523, in the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) gene that provides greatly increased precision in the estimation of age of LOAD onset for APOE ε3 carriers. In two independent clinical cohorts, longer lengths of rs10524523 are associated with a higher risk for LOAD. For APOE ε3/4 patients who developed LOAD after 60 years of age, individuals with long poly-T repeats linked to APOE ε3 develop LOAD on an average of 7 years earlier than individuals with shorter poly-T repeats linked to APOE ε3 (70.5±1.2 years versus 77.6±2.1 years, P=0.02, n=34). Independent mutation events at rs10524523 that occurred during Caucasian evolution have given rise to multiple categories of poly-T length variants at this locus. On replication, these results will have clinical utility for predictive risk estimates for LOAD and for enabling clinical disease prevention studies. In addition, these results show the effective use of a phylogenetic approach for analysis of haplotypes of polymorphisms, including structural polymorphisms, which contribute to complex diseases.},

	abstract = {For nearly a century, detecting the genetic contributions to cognitive and behavioral phenomena has been a core interest for psychological research. Recently, this interest has been reinvigorated by the availability of genotyping technologies (e.g., microarrays) that provide new genetic data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs-which represent pairs of nucleotide letters (e.g., AA, AG, or GG) found at specific positions on human chromosomes-are best considered as categorical variables, but this coding scheme can make difficult the multivariate analysis of their relationships with behavioral measurements, because most multivariate techniques developed for the analysis between sets of variables are designed for quantitative variables. To palliate this problem, we present a generalization of partial least squares-a technique used to extract the information common to 2 different data tables measured on the same observations-called partial least squares correspondence analysis-that is specifically tailored for the analysis of categorical and mixed ("heterogeneous") data types. Here, we formally define and illustrate-in a tutorial format-how partial least squares correspondence analysis extends to various types of data and design problems that are particularly relevant for psychological research that include genetic data. We illustrate partial least squares correspondence analysis with genetic, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

We approximate the matrix X as , where dk, uk, and vk minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X, subject to penalties on uk and vk. This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L1-penalties on uk and vk, which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L1-penalty on vk but not on uk, a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the “SCoTLASS” proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

Therefore, obtaining robust information regarding the expression, splicing and genetic regulation of this gene within the human brain is of immense importance. In this study, we used 2011 brain samples originating from 439 individuals to provide the most reliable and coherent information on the regional expression, splicing and regulation of MAPT available to date. We found significant regional variation in mRNA expression and splicing of MAPT within the human brain. Furthermore, at the gene level, the regional distribution of mRNA expression and total tau protein expression levels were largely in agreement, appearing to be highly correlated. Finally and most importantly, we show that while the reported H1/H2 association with gene level expression is likely to be due to a technical artefact, this polymorphism is associated with the expression of exon 3-containing isoforms in human brain. These findings would suggest that contrary to the prevailing view, genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases at the MAPT locus are likely to operate by changing mRNA splicing in different brain regions, as opposed to the overall expression of the MAPT gene.},

The predominant model for testing APOE involves the haplotype combinations of e2, e3, and e4 and has been basis of associations with dementia, atherosclerosis, and serum lipid levels. Here, we demonstrate the functional independence of these two component sites, with rs7412 contributing to the majority of variance in serum LDL (p=10-20), whereas rs429358 alone influences variance in CSF amyloid-{$\beta$}42 (A{$\beta$}42) (p=10(-17)). This latter relationship is also reflected in the association of APOE with dementia, where rs429358 strongly influences disease (p=10(-67)), but rs7412 does not. Models based upon e2, e3, and e4 explained less variance for both dementia risk and CSF A{$\beta$}42 than did rs429358 alone. When adjusted for CSF A{$\beta$}42, the association of rs429358 with dementia is greatly reduced but remains significant indicating that APOE polymorphism influences disease by additional mechanisms distinct from A{$\beta$}42 metabolism. We reach four principal conclusion from this study: 1) rs429358 alone is responsible for the association of APOE with dementia; 2) The association of APOE with dementia is substantially mediated by its effect on CNS A{$\beta$}42 levels; 3) The association of APOE with dementia is not mediated by its impact on peripheral lipid metabolism; and 4) The dichotomy of effects of rs429358 and rs7412 represents one of the best examples of genetic pleiotropy for complex traits known and illustrates the importance of allelic heterogeneity in APOE.},

Using a sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, we performed three separate studies that each compared two groups of individuals to identify genes associated with disease development and progression. For each comparison we took a two-step approach: initially, using penalized linear discriminant analysis, we identified voxels that provide an imaging signature of the disease with high classification accuracy; then we used this multivariate biomarker as a phenotype in a genome-wide association study, carried out using sRRR. The genetic markers were ranked in order of importance of association to the phenotypes using a data re-sampling approach. Our findings confirmed the key role of the APOE and TOMM40 genes but also highlighted some novel potential associations with AD.},

We report sequence data for 439 probands from late-onset AD families with a history of four or more affected individuals. Sixty sequenced individuals (13.7\%) carried a novel or pathogenic mutation. Eight pathogenic variants, (one each in APP and MAPT, two in PSEN1 and four in GRN) three of which are novel, were found in 14 samples. Thirteen additional variants, present in 23 families, did not segregate with disease, but the frequency of these variants is higher in AD cases than controls, indicating that these variants may also modify risk for disease. The frequency of rare variants in these genes in this series is significantly higher than in the 1,000 genome project (p = 5.09×10−5; OR = 2.21; 95\%CI = 1.49–3.28) or an unselected population of 12,481 samples (p = 6.82×10−5; OR = 2.19; 95\%CI = 1.347–3.26). Rare coding variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, increase risk for or cause late onset AD. The presence of variants in these genes in LOAD and early-onset AD demonstrates that factors other than the mutation can impact the age at onset and penetrance of at least some variants associated with AD. MAPT and GRN mutations can be found in clinical series of AD most likely due to misdiagnosis. This study clearly demonstrates that rare variants in these genes could explain an important proportion of genetic heritability of AD, which is not detected by GWAS.},

We calculated AD LTR in 7351 cases and 10 132 controls from Caucasian ancestry using Rochester (USA) incidence data. At the age of 85 the LTR of AD without reference to APOE genotype was 11\% in males and 14\% in females. At the same age, this risk ranged from 51\% for APOE44 male carriers to 60\% for APOE44 female carriers, and from 23\% for APOE34 male carriers to 30\% for APOE34 female carriers, consistent with semi-dominant inheritance of a moderately penetrant gene. Using PAQUID (France) incidence data, estimates were globally similar except that at age 85 the LTRs reached 68 and 35\% for APOE 44 and APOE 34 female carriers, respectively. These risks are more similar to those of major genes in Mendelian diseases, such as BRCA1 in breast cancer, than those of low-risk common alleles identified by recent GWAS in complex diseases. In addition, stratification of our data by age groups clearly demonstrates that APOE4 is a risk factor not only for late-onset but for early-onset AD as well. Together, these results urge a reappraisal of the impact of APOE in Alzheimer disease.},

MFA proceeds in two steps: First it computes a PCA of each data table and ‘normalizes’ each data table by dividing all its elements by the first singular value obtained from its PCA. Second, all the normalized data tables are aggregated into a grand data table that is analyzed via a (non-normalized) PCA that gives a set of factor scores for the observations and loadings for the variables. In addition, MFA provides for each data table a set of partial factor scores for the observations that reflects the specific ‘view-point’ of this data table. Interestingly, the common factor scores could be obtained by replacing the original normalized data tables by the normalized factor scores obtained from the PCA of each of these tables. In this article, we present MFA, review recent extensions, and illustrate it with a detailed example. WIREs Comput Stat 2013, 5:149–179. doi: 10.1002/wics.1246},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01423},
	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, the interpretability of PCA remains limited. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as Sparse PCA, have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images accounting for most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining l1 and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes higher order information about the structure of the data. This paper presents the structured sparse PCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of SPCA-TV on three different data sets. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches are significant,since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easy to interpret, and are more stable across different samples.},

	abstract = {Regularized principal components analysis, especially Sparse PCA and Functional PCA, has become widely used for dimension reduction in high-dimensional settings. Many examples of massive data, however, may benefit from estimating both sparse AND functional factors. These include neuroimaging data where there are discrete brain regions of activation (sparsity) but these regions tend to be smooth spatially (functional). Here, we introduce an optimization framework that can encourage both sparsity and smoothness of the row and/or column PCA factors. This framework generalizes many of the existing approaches to Sparse PCA, Functional PCA and two-way Sparse PCA and Functional PCA, as these are all special cases of our method. In particular, our method permits flexible combinations of sparsity and smoothness that lead to improvements in feature selection and signal recovery as well as more interpretable PCA factors. We demonstrate our method on simulated data and a neuroimaging example on EEG data. This work provides a unified framework for regularized PCA that can form the foundation for a cohesive approach to regularization in high-dimensional multivariate analysis.},

It is unique as a multivariate method in its choice of emphasis for analysis, that being the covariance between brain images and exogenous blocks representing either the experiment design or some behavioral measure. What emerges are spatial patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association between the images and either of the blocks. This process differs substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels, PLS attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task or behavior. Data from a face encoding and recognition PET rCBF study are used to illustrate two types of PLS analysis: an activation analysis of task with images and a brain–behavior analysis. The commonalities across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. PLS thus serves as an important extension by extracting new information from imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.},

Classical multivariate techniques ignore these structural relationships often resulting in poor performance. We propose a generalization of principal components analysis (PCA) that is appropriate for massive datasets with structured variables or known two-way dependencies. By finding the best low-rank approximation of the data with respect to a transposable quadratic norm, our decomposition, entitled the generalized least-square matrix decomposition (GMD), directly accounts for structural relationships. As many variables in high-dimensional settings are often irrelevant, we also regularize our matrix decomposition by adding two-way penalties to encourage sparsity or smoothness. We develop fast computational algorithms using our methods to perform generalized PCA (GPCA), sparse GPCA, and functional GPCA on massive datasets. Through simulations and a whole brain functional MRI example, we demonstrate the utility of our methodology for dimension reduction, signal recovery, and feature selection with high-dimensional structured data.

RGCCA is a component-based approach which aims to study the relationships between several sets of variables.

Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, RGCCA is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) is proposed to combine RGCCA with an ℓ1{\textbackslash}ell \_1-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes SGCCA a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of SGCCA are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma.

	abstract = {There is substantial evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of both A{$\beta$}42 and tau/ptau are promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show that both A{$\beta$} and tau exhibit more than 10-fold interindividual variation in CSF levels suggesting that these biomarkers may also be effectively used as endophenotypes for genetic studies of AD. To test the role of common variation in the gene encoding microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) in influencing CSF tau/ptau levels, we genotyped 21 MAPT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 313 individuals and tested for association with CSF tau/ptau levels. We identified alleles of several SNPs that show association with increased CSF tau/ptau levels. When CSF A{$\beta$}42 levels were used to stratify the sample into those with and without likely A{$\beta$} deposition in the brain the association was only observed in individuals with evidence of A{$\beta$} deposition. This association was replicated in an independent CSF series. When these SNPs were evaluated in a late-onset AD case control series the alleles associated with higher CSF tau/ptau were associated with an earlier age at onset but had no effect on risk for AD. In vivo gene expression studies show that these alleles are associated with increased MAPT mRNA levels in individuals with evidence of brain A{$\beta$} deposition. This endophenotype-based approach provides evidence for a gene (MAPT SNPs)–physiological environment (A{$\beta$} deposition) interaction that places changes in CSF tau after A{$\beta$} deposition and suggest that this interaction predisposes for the development of tauopathy and accelerated disease progression.},

	abstract = {AbstractBackground
We investigated the genomic region spanning the Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40-kD (TOMM40) and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes, that has been associated with the risk and age of onset of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) to determine whether a highly polymorphic, intronic poly-T within this region (rs10524523; hereafter, 523) affects expression of the APOE and TOMM40 genes. Alleles of this locus are classified as S, short; L, long; and VL, very long based on the number of T residues.
Methods
We evaluated differences in APOE messenger RNA (mRNA) and TOMM40 mRNA levels as a function of the 523 genotype in two brain regions from APOE ε3/ε3 white autopsy-confirmed LOAD cases and normal controls. We further investigated the effect of the 523 locus in its native genomic context using a luciferase expression system.
Results
The expression of both genes was significantly increased with disease. Mean expression of APOE and TOMM40 mRNA levels were higher in VL homozygotes compared with S homozygotes in the temporal and occipital cortexes from normal and LOAD cases. Results of a luciferase reporter system were consistent with the human brain mRNA analysis; the 523 VL poly-T resulted in significantly higher expression than the S poly-T. Although the effect of poly-T length on reporter expression was the same in HepG2 hepatoma and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, the magnitude of the effect was greater in the neuroblastoma than in the hepatoma cells, which implies tissue-specific modulation of the 523 poly-T.
Conclusions
These results suggest that the 523 locus may contribute to LOAD susceptibility by modulating the expression of TOMM40 and/or APOE transcription.},

	abstract = {Summary
Human apolipoprotein E (ApoE) apolipoprotein is primarily expressed in three isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4) that differ only by two residues. ApoE4 constitutes the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), ApoE3 is neutral, and ApoE2 is protective. How ApoE isoforms influence AD pathogenesis, however, remains unclear. Using ES-cell-derived human neurons, we show that ApoE secreted by glia stimulates neuronal A{$\beta$} production with an ApoE4 \&gt; ApoE3 \&gt; ApoE2 potency rank order. We demonstrate that ApoE binding to ApoE receptors activates dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK), a MAP-kinase kinase kinase that then activates MKK7 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Activated ERK1/2 induces cFos phosphorylation, stimulating the transcription factor AP-1, which in turn enhances transcription of amyloid-{$\beta$} precursor protein (APP) and thereby increases amyloid-{$\beta$} levels. This molecular mechanism also regulates APP transcription in mice in vivo. Our data describe a novel signal transduction pathway in neurons whereby ApoE activates a non-canonical MAP kinase cascade that enhances APP transcription and amyloid-{$\beta$} synthesis.},

In these same samples, these SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study (DPS). All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb ≤1 (mild) at initial clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS. Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 alone and change in CDR-sb (P {\textgreater} .10), there was a significant association between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed {\textgreater}2.9 times faster than noncarriers (P = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30\% faster for each copy of the high-risk allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed 6 times faster (P {\textless} .0001) than all others combined. We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic strategies.},

In two independent clinical cohorts, longer lengths of rs10524523 are associated with a higher risk for LOAD. For APOE ɛ3/4 patients who developed LOAD after 60 years of age, individuals with long poly-T repeats linked to APOE ɛ3 develop LOAD on an average of 7 years earlier than individuals with shorter poly-T repeats linked to APOE ɛ3 (70.5 ± 1.2 years versus 77.6 ± 2.1 years, P=0.02, n=34). Independent mutation events at rs10524523 that occurred during Caucasian evolution have given rise to multiple categories of poly-T length variants at this locus.

At a time when the availability of fMRI data is rapidly growing—primarily through large, publicly available grassroots datasets—automated quality control and outlier detection methods are greatly needed. We propose principal components analysis (PCA) leverage and demonstrate how it can be used to identify outlying time points in an fMRI run. Furthermore, PCA leverage is a measure of the influence of each observation on the estimation of principal components, which are often of interest in fMRI data. We also propose an alternative measure, PCA robust distance, which is less sensitive to outliers and has controllable statistical properties. The proposed methods are validated through simulation studies and are shown to be highly accurate. We also conduct a reliability study using resting-state fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and find that removal of outliers using the proposed methods results in more reliable estimation of subject-level resting-state networks using independent components analysis.},

Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation.

Our NPAIRS (nonparametric prediction, activation, influence, and reproducibility resampling) framework provides an alternative to simulations and ROC curves by using real PET and fMRI data sets to examine the relationship between prediction accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) associated with reproducible SPMs. Using cross-validation resampling we plot training–test set predictions of the experimental design variables (e.g., brain-state labels) versus reproducibility SNR metrics for the associated SPMs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework across the wide range of performance metrics obtained from [15O]water PET studies of 12 age- and sex-matched data sets performing different motor tasks (8 subjects/set). For the 12 data sets we apply NPAIRS with both univariate and multivariate data-analysis approaches to: (1) demonstrate that this framework may be used to obtain reproducible SPMs from any data-analysis approach on a common Z-score scale (rSPM\{Z\}); (2) demonstrate that the histogram of a rSPM\{Z\} image may be modeled as the sum of a data-analysis-dependent noise distribution and a task-dependent, Gaussian signal distribution that scales monotonically with our reproducibility performance metric; (3) explore the relation between prediction and reproducibility performance metrics with an emphasis on bias-variance tradeoffs for flexible, multivariate models; and (4) measure the broad range of reproducibility SNRs and the significant influence of individual subjects. A companion paper describes learning curves for four of these 12 data sets, which describe an alternative mutual-information prediction metric and NPAIRS reproducibility as a function of training-set sizes from 2 to 18 subjects.

Subjects The study involved a geometric phantom, a single individual volunteer, and 143 cognitively healthy, mild cognitively impaired, and Alzheimer's disease participants in a large-scale, multicentric study. Field Strength/Sequences MRI was perform with 3T scanners (GE, Philips, Siemens) and included 3D T1w, PD/T2w, , T2w-FLAIR, diffusion, and BOLD resting state acquisitions. Assessment Measures included signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios (SNR and CNR, respectively), total brain volumes, and total scan time. Statistical Tests SNR, CNR, and scan time were compared between scanner vendors using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey tests, while brain volumes were tested using linear mixed models. Results Geometric phantom T1w SNR was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) higher in Philips (mean: 71.4) than Siemens (29.5), while no significant difference was observed between vendors for T2w (32.0 and 37.2, respectively, P = 0.243). Single individual volunteer T1w CNR was higher in subcortical regions for Siemens (P {\textless} 0.001), while Philips had higher cortical CNR (P = 0.044). No significant difference in brain volumes was observed between vendors (P = 0.310/0.582/0.055). The average scan time was 41.0 minutes (SD: 2.8) and was not significantly different between sites (P = 0.071) and cognitive groups (P = 0.853). Data Conclusion The harmonized Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol suits the needs of studies that need to ensure quality MRI data acquisition for the measurement of brain changes across adulthood, due to aging, neurodegeneration, and other etiologies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association of cognitive and motor impairments in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases is thought to be related to damage in the common brain networks shared by cognitive and cortical motor control processes. These common brain networks play a pivotal role in selecting movements and postural synergies that meet an individual's needs. Pathology in this "highest level" of motor control produces abnormalities of gait and posture referred to as highest-level gait disorders. Impairments in cognition and mobility, including falls, are present in almost all neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting common mechanisms that still need to be unraveled.
OBJECTIVE: To identify motor-cognitive profiles across neurodegenerative diseases in a large cohort of patients.
METHODS: Cohort study that includes up to 500 participants, followed every year for three years, across five neurodegenerative disease groups: Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal degeneration, vascular cognitive impairment, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Gait and balance will be assessed using accelerometers and electronic walkways, evaluated at different levels of cognitive and sensory complexity, using the dual-task paradigm.
RESULTS: Comparison of cognitive and motor performances across neurodegenerative groups will allow the identification of motor-cognitive phenotypes through the standardized evaluation of gait and balance characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: As part of the Ontario Neurodegenerative Research Initiative (ONDRI), the gait and balance platform aims to identify motor-cognitive profiles across neurodegenerative diseases. Gait assessment, particularly while dual-tasking, will help dissect the cognitive and motor contribution in mobility and cognitive decline, progression to dementia syndromes, and future adverse outcomes including falls and mortality.},

	abstract = {Correspondence analysis (CA) is a method of data visualization that is applicable to cross-tabular data such as counts, compositions, or any ratio-scale data where relative values are of interest. All the data should be on the same scale and the row and column margins of the table must make sense as weighting factors because the analysis gives varying importance to the respective rows and columns according to these margins. This method is one of a large class of methods based on the singular value decomposition and can be considered as the equivalent of principal component analysis for categorical and ratio-scale data or as a pair of classical scalings of the rows and columns based on their interpoint χ2 distances, using the margins as weights. For categorical data, this method generalizes to multiple CA, a popular method for analyzing questionnaire data. A linearly constrained form of CA, canonical CA, is extensively used in ecological research where species abundance data at various sampling points are visualized subject to being linearly related to environmental variables measured at the same locations. When certain parameters are introduced into its definition, CA has been shown to have limiting cases of unweighted and weighted log-ratio analysis (the latter also known as the spectral map), as well as classical multidimensional scaling.

Its goal is to predict a set of dependent variables from a set of independent variables or predictors. This prediction is achieved by extracting from the predictors a set of orthogonal factors called latent variables which have the best predictive power. These latent variables can be used to create displays akin to PCA displays. The quality of the prediction obtained from a PLS regression model is evaluated with cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and jackknife. There are two main variants of PLS regression: The most common one separates the roles of dependent and independent variables; the second one—used mostly to analyze brain imaging data—gives the same roles to dependent and independent variables.

This technique is specially suited to deal with a much larger number of predictors than observations and with multicollineality, two of the main problems encountered when analysing microarray expression data. We explore the performance of PLS-DA with published data from breast cancer (Perou et al. 2000). Several such analyses were carried out: (1) before vs after chemotherapy treatment, (2) estrogen receptor positive vs negative tumours, and (3) tumour classification. We found that the performance of PLS-DA was extremely satisfactory in all cases and that the discriminant cDNA clones often had a sound biological interpretation. We conclude that PLS-DA is a powerful yet simple tool for analysing microarray data.},

	abstract = {Advances in analytical instrumentation have provided the possibility of examining thousands of genes, peptides, or metabolites in parallel. However, the cost and time-consuming data acquisition process causes a generalized lack of samples. From a data analysis perspective, omics data are characterized by high dimensionality and small sample counts. In many scenarios, the analytical aim is to differentiate between two different conditions or classes combining an analytical method plus a tailored qualitative predictive model using available examples collected in a dataset. For this purpose, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is frequently employed in omics research. Recently, there has been growing concern about the uncritical use of this method, since it is prone to overfitting and may aggravate problems of false discoveries. In many applications involving a small number of subjects or samples, predictive model performance estimation is only based on cross-validation (CV) results with a strong preference for reporting results using leave one out (LOO). The combination of PLS-DA for high dimensionality data and small sample conditions, together with a weak validation methodology is a recipe for unreliable estimations of model performance. In this work, we present a systematic study about the impact of the dataset size, the dimensionality, and the CV technique used on PLS-DA overoptimism when performance estimation is done in cross-validation. Firstly, by using synthetic data generated from a same probability distribution and with assigned random binary labels, we have obtained a dataset where the true classification rate (CR) is 50\%. As expected, our results confirm that internal validation provides overoptimistic estimations of the classification accuracy (i.e., overfitting). We have characterized the CR estimator in terms of bias and variance depending on the internal CV technique used and sample to dimensionality ratio. In small sample conditions, due to the large bias and variance of the estimator, the occurrence of extremely good CRs is common. We have found that overfitting peaks when the sample size in the training subset approaches the feature vector dimensionality minus one. In these conditions, the models are neither under- or overdetermined with a unique solution. This effect is particularly intense for LOO and peaks higher in small sample conditions. Overoptimism is decreased beyond this point where the abundance of noisy produces a regularization effect leading to less complex models. In terms of overfitting, our study ranks CV methods as follows: Bootstrap produces the most accurate estimator of the CR, followed by bootstrapped Latin partitions, random subsampling, K-Fold, and finally, the very popular LOO provides the worst results. Simulation results are further confirmed in real datasets from mass spectrometry and microarrays.},

	abstract = {Background
The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) is widely used in AD, but may be less responsive to change when used in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Methods
Participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were administered a neuropsychological battery and 1.5 T MRI scans over 2–3 years. Informants were queried regarding functional impairments. Some participants had lumbar punctures to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We added executive functioning (EF) and functional ability (FA) items to the ADAS-Cog to generate candidate augmented measures. We calibrated these candidates using baseline data (n=811) and selected the best candidate that added EF items alone and that added EF and FA items. We selected candidates based on their responsiveness over three years in a training sample of participants with MCI (n=160). We compared traditional ADAS-Cog scores with the two candidates based on their responsiveness in a validation sample of participants with MCI (n=234), ability to predict conversion to dementia (n=394), strength of association with baseline MRI (n=394) and CSF biomarkers (n=193).

Results
The selected EF candidate added category fluency (ADAS Plus EF), and the selected EF and FA candidate added category fluency, Digit Symbol, Trail Making, and five items from the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (ADAS Plus EF\&FA). The ADAS Plus EF\& FA performed as well as or better than traditional ADAS-Cog scores.

Conclusion
Adding EF and FA items to the ADAS-Cog may improve responsiveness among people with MCI without impairing validity.},

Participants: Ninety-four patients meeting MCI clinical criteria supported by psychometric measures, 93 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score≥17), and 90 healthy elderly controls (NC). Measurements: The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, and sensitivity and specificity of both measures were assessed for detection of MCI and mild AD. Results: Using a cutoff score 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 18\% to detect MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 90\% of MCI subjects. In the mild AD group, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 78\%, whereas the MoCA detected 100\%. Specificity was excellent for both MMSE and MoCA (100\% and 87\%, respectively). Conclusion: MCI as an entity is evolving and somewhat controversial. The MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI as currently conceptualized in patients performing in the normal range on the MMSE.},

Here, to search for low-frequency variants in the amyloid-{$\beta$} precursor protein (APP) gene with a significant effect on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, we studied coding variants in APP in a set of whole-genome sequence data from 1,795 Icelanders. We found a coding mutation (A673T) in the APP gene that protects against Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer’s disease. This substitution is adjacent to the aspartyl protease {$\beta$}-site in APP, and results in an approximately 40\% reduction in the formation of amyloidogenic peptides in vitro. The strong protective effect of the A673T substitution against Alzheimer’s disease provides proof of principle for the hypothesis that reducing the {$\beta$}-cleavage of APP may protect against the disease. Furthermore, as the A673T allele also protects against cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer’s disease, the two may be mediated through the same or similar mechanisms.},

A ridge type of regularization was incorporated into a variety of NSCA: Ordinary NSCA, and Partial and/or Constrained NSCA. The regularization has proven useful in obtaining estimates of parameters, which are on average closer to the true population values. An optimal value of the regularization parameter is found by a G-fold cross validation method, and the best dimensionality of the solution space is determined by permutation tests. A bootstrap method is used to evaluate the stability of the solution. A small Monte Carlo study and an illustrative example demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed procedures.},

Such a procedure is very useful when it is known that there is a symmetric (two-way) relationship between the variables. When such a relationship is known not to exist, non-symmetrical correspondence analysis is more appropriate as a method of establishing the source of association. This paper highlights some tools that can be used to explore the behaviour of asymmetric categorical variables. These tools consist of confidence regions, the link between non-symmetrical correspondence analysis and the analysis of variance of categorical variables, and the effect of imposing linear constraints. We also explore the application of non-symmetrical correspondence analysis to three-way contingency tables.},

By incorporating prior known relationships among the variables, these analyses have been successful in elucidating the relationships between different sets of omics data. In this article, our goal is to identify important relationships between genomic expression and cytokine data from a human immunodeficiency virus vaccine trial. We proposed a flexible partial least squares technique, which incorporates group and subgroup structure in the modelling process. Our new method accounts for both grouping of genetic markers (eg, gene sets) and temporal effects. The method generalises existing sparse modelling techniques in the partial least squares methodology and establishes theoretical connections to variable selection methods for supervised and unsupervised problems. Simulation studies are performed to investigate the performance of our methods over alternative sparse approaches. Our R package sgspls is available at https://github.com/matt-sutton/sgspls.},

	abstract = {Brain imaging is increasingly recognised as an intermediate phenotype to understand the complex path between genetics and behavioural or clinical phenotypes. In this context, a first goal is to propose methods to identify the part of genetic variability that explains some neuroimaging variability. Classical univariate approaches often ignore the potential joint effects that may exist between genes or the potential covariations between brain regions. In this paper, we propose instead to investigate an exploratory multivariate method in order to identify a set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) covarying with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes derived from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Recently, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed to analyse DNA and transcriptomics. Here, we propose to transpose this idea to the DNA vs. imaging context. However, in very high-dimensional settings like in imaging genetics studies, such multivariate methods may encounter overfitting issues. Thus we investigate the use of different strategies of regularisation and dimension reduction techniques combined with PLS or CCA to face the very high dimensionality of imaging genetics studies. We propose a comparison study of the different strategies on a simulated dataset first and then on a real dataset composed of 94 subjects, around 600,000 SNPs and 34 functional MRI lateralisation indexes computed from reading and speech comprehension contrast maps. We estimate the generalisability of the multivariate association with a cross-validation scheme and demonstrate the significance of this link, using a permutation procedure. Univariate selection appears to be necessary to reduce the dimensionality. However, the significant association uncovered by this two-step approach combining univariate filtering and L1-regularised PLS suggests that discovering meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate approach.},

The former underlies the least squares estimation in regression analysis, which is essentially a projection of one subspace onto another, and the latter underlies principal component analysis, which seeks to find a subspace that captures the largest variability in the original space.This book is about projections and SVD. A thorough discussion of generalized inverse (g-inverse) matrices is also given because it is closely related to the former. The book provides systematic and in-depth accounts of these concepts from a unified viewpoint of linear transformations finite dimensional vector spaces. More specially, it shows that projection matrices (projectors) and g-inverse matrices can be defined in various ways so that a vector space is decomposed into a direct-sum of (disjoint) subspaces. Projection Matrices, Generalized Inverse Matrices, and Singular Value Decomposition will be useful for researchers, practitioners, and students in applied mathematics, statistics, engineering, behaviormetrics, and other fields.},

The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations.

	abstract = {Using a metabolomics data set with 1057 serum samples, we designed and assessed different procedures based on Monte Carlo resampling schemes to determine the optimal number of components to be included in partial least squares (PLS) regression models. Corresponding estimates of prediction error were calculated and compared in a single algorithm comprising i) a single loop Monte Carlo approach repeatedly and randomly splitting samples into calibration and validation samples, ii) a double loop validation splitting samples into calibration/validation and prediction sets, and, iii) independent sample sets in a third loop. In order to mimic the common situation with only a moderate number of samples available for building the model, only a fraction of the 1057 samples analyzed was randomly selected from the total sample set and used in the algorithm. The results show that if the samples available for modelling are representative for the future samples to be predicted from the model, the single loop Monte Carlo procedure consistently provides the same estimates of prediction errors as double loop resampling procedures and for 75\% of the cases these estimates are the same as for independent prediction sets. This has important implications for optimal use of a training set for component selection and estimation of prediction error. Two methods were developed and compared for selecting the optimal number of PLS components defined as the number where no statistically significant improvement in prediction error is observed when additional components are included in the model. Both methods determine a probability measure and provide similar results for model selection in this application.},

PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},
