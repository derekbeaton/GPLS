# Introduction

Generalized partial least squares (GPLS) is a new framework we have introduced. The GPLS framework provides 

- unification of "two table" multivariate techniques, generally partial least squares, canonical correlation, and reduced rank regression (a.k.a. redundancy analysis)
- flexibility to generalize those methods to different data types, such as continuous, categorical, ordinal, or mixtures of those types
- harmonization of these methods through the singular value decomposition (SVD), and the newly introduced "GPLSSVD" (an analog to the generalized SVD). 


# Vignettes in the GPLS package

In the GPLS package we provide a small set of vignettes that comprehensively covers the breadth of techniques and the depth of generalizations. Those vignettes are:

- "Classic canonical methods": which covers several variants of partial least squares, canonical correltaion analysis, and reduced rank regression (a.k.a. redundancy analysis)
- "Recoding and transforming data": which focuses on specific utilities designed to transform data types into analyzable matrices (e.g., categorical to complete disjunctive data; ordinal to "fuzzy" coding)
- "Analyzing categorical data": which focuses on a PLS method initially designed for categorical data called partial least squares called "partial least squares correspondence analysis" (PLSCA)
- "Analyzing mixtures of data": which ties together the "recoding" and "analyzing categorical data" vignettes
- "Exploring optimizations and ridge regularization": which provides a few examples of how to dive more deeply into the core GPLS algorithms (via `GSVD::gplssvd()`) by using different weights (constraints) to produce different optimizations, and how those weights naturally lead to ridge-like regularization
